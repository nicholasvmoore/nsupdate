tb-nsupdate
========

This is a fork of the nsupdate script that focuses only on the tunnel broker portion. There is an accompanying script that comes with it much like in nsupdate but I've renamed it to tb-nsupdate respectively.  Feel free to use this or incorporate it in anything you want.

Maybe someday the ISP's will get over the price gouging of static IPv6 addresses
